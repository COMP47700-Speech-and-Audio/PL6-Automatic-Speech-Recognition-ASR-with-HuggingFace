# COMP47700 Speech and Audio PL6: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) with HuggingFace
---

## Learning outcomes
This practical tutorial covers the following learning outcomes within the COMP47700 Speech and Audio module:
* Recognise and reflect on the relationship between the underlying theories and start-of-the-art research (**LO4**)
  * Familiarise yourself with current available frameworks and tools for ASR (HuggingFace, Whisper)
  * Load and test SotA models for ASR using HuggingFace
* Create programmes to conduct experiments on speech and audio samples building on third software libraries (**LO6**)
  * Evaluate model's performance for ASR
  * Familiarise yourself with current available datasets for ASR tasks


## Module topics
This practical tutorial builds on the following core topics:
* Automatic speech recognition and speaker recognition (Unit 9)

## Why is it important?
* Understanding ASR and speaker recognition is crucial for developing a wide range of applications, from voice-controlled interfaces to security systems and personalized user experiences. These technologies play a key role in enhancing human-computer interaction and making technology more versatile and accessible.
* Getting familiar with SoTA frameworks like HuggingFace is essential for leveraging the platform effectively, developing customized models, integrating with other NLP tools, and contributing to the collaborative and dynamic community focused on advancing speech-related tasks, natural language processing and machine learning.

## Structure of this tutorial
This practical tutorial contains different sections:
* **Live coding:** Basic theory, demos and coding examples presented by the lecturer on site (unmarked)
* **Student activity:** Familiarisation and coding exercises to be completed by the students and followed by a short discussion on site (unmarked). These activites introduce key concepts and skills necessary to complete the assignments.
* **Assignment:** Three (3) take home problem/coding questions to be completed by the students and due in two (2) weeks from the day the practical tutorial is given.
